Android App for the travelers from Romania: my three-member team have developed this app for the NGO JRS Romania, to help the refugees and travelers to find information about the local population and free services.

The app uses gooogle API and has a simple interface. When started, a map appears. The map is centered on user's location. On the map the user can see objectives, which display information when clicked. Also the user has a "drawer menu" that opens when the user touch-moves the left side of the screen from the outside to the inside.
